# Introduction

Flutterando Metrics is a static analysis tool that helps you analyse and improve your code quality.

It collects analytical data on the code through calculating code metrics with configurable thresholds and provides additional rules for the Dart analyzer.

It can be launched via the command line or as a library. Launching via the command line allows you to easily integrate the tool into the CI/CD process, and you can get results in Ð¡onsole, HTML, JSON, CodeClimate, or GitHub.

## Metrics {#metrics}

Metrics can help manage codebase for teams or individuals working on both big and small projects.

Big projects usually have their own history with contributions from different people and sometimes it's really hard to detect places in the codebase that need attention the most.

For small projects metrics can help avoid the stage when codebase becomes harder to maintain because they provide instant feedback on any PR and questionable solutions might not even be merged into the main branch.
